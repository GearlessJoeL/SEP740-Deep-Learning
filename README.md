# SEP740-Deep-Learning

This is the repository for Sep 740 Deep Learning

All you need to do is to run the main.ipynb, the other modules are already ready.

This project is inspired by Li, Y., Guo, S., Li, L., Yu, Y., & Tashi, N. (2023, December). Towards Robust Handwritten Tibetan Numeral Recognition with Spiking Neural Networks. In Proceedings of the 2023 9th International Conference on Communication and Information Processing (pp. 107-111).
